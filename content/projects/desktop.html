	<h2>Process Manager</h2>
	<p>
		Process Manager is a replacement application for the built-in Windows Task Manager with a lot of
		additional features. It keeps running in the background after closing the main window and can be
		brought back from the tray icon or by pressing Ctrl+F12.<br /><br />
		Features:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Listing hidden and tool windows that are not visible in the normal task manager</li>
			<li>Interaction with services: run, stop, add new service</li>
			<li>Listing loaded drivers (mainly .SYS files)</li>
			<li>Interaction with processes: stop, restart, setting priority</li>
			<li>Listing .DLL files loaded by a process</li>
			<li>Listing C functions in a .DLL file</li>
			<li>Extracting icons stored in .EXE files and saving them to disk</li>
			<li>Shut down the computer, log off, switch user, etc</li>
			<li>Open default Windows Task Manager</li>
			<li>Run a new process (similar to Win+R)</li>
			<li>Choosing between Hungarian and English language</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Windows Manager</h2>
	<p>
		Windows Manager is a reworked and extended edition of Process Manager. Besides the improved
		visual appearance it introduces new window tweaking options which you can see in the picture.
		One can for example change a sticky (always on top) window to act as a normal one.<br /><br />
		Features:<br />
		<ul>
			<li><u>Everything Process Manager was capable of</u></li>
			<li>Tweaking windows, like changing stickyness, window type, control buttons, etc</li>
			<li>Window analyzer: displays the parent process of the window in focus</li>
			<li>Displaying CPU information: CPU type and manufacturer, frequency and idle state for each core</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Logic Circuit Simulator</h2>
	<p>
		Logic Circuit Simulator was a university project I developed together with a friend of mine.
		It offers a variety of logic gates and a lot of visual customization options. Some special elements are
		also available, like seven-segment display, matrix display, JK flip-flop, adjustable timer and
		<i>module</i>. A selected part of a logic circuit can be converted to a module, where the circuit's
		input elements (buttons, switches) become the input pins and output elements (LEDs) become the
		output pins of the module. Modules also support recursion.<br /><br />
		Features:</br />
		<ul>
			<li>Gates: AND, NAND, NOT, OR, NOR, XOR, NXOR</li>
			<li>Inputs: switch, push button, adjustable timer</li>
			<li>Outputs: LED, seven-segment display, matrix display</li>
			<li>Special elements: JK flip-flop, module</li>
			<li>Visual customization options and themes (presets)</li>
			<li>Multiple projects tabs</li>
			<li>Minimap: an optional separate windows which shows<br />
				the whole circuit in miniature scale</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Razzie Messenger</h2>
	<p>
		Razzie Messenger is a messenger client and server I started working on during a one-week vacation
		at lake Balaton (Hungary). If you are wondering about the choice of name, Razzie is my internet
		nickname.<br />
		The messenger uses a very simple plain text based protocol for network communication, look at the
		picture to see it in details. (Since then I prefer binary protocols due to the ineffeciency of
		string parsing and large packet sizes in case of text protocols.) The user can chose a nickname
		and pick colors for the name and the text messages. There is no registration and password authentication,
		however the server rejects the connection if a nickname is already taken in the current session. It is
		possible to send a file to an other user: in this case the server opens a random port which receives and
		forwards the file. Both users have to connect to this port, but it is done automatically.
		This solution was necessary due to the limitations of the text based protocol.<br /><br />
		Features:</br >
		<ul>
			<li>User states: available, away, hidden (can still communicate), passive (can't communicate)</li>
			<li>Displays several smileys visually</li>
			<li>File sending option (drag & drop)</li>
			<li>Nudge (shakes the other user's screen)</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Server - client application</h2>
	<p>
		Server - client application is a small tool which helps creating and debugging text based network
		protocols. I developed it while working on Razzie Messenger and it had a great use. On the server tab
		the user can select one of the connected clients as a message target or just close the connection to them.<br /><br />
		Features:</br >
		<ul>
			<li>Server: listening on selected port, sending messages to connected clients separately, sending welcome message
				to new connections (optional)</li>
			<li>Client: connecting to selected host (ip or hostname) and port, sending messages to server</li>
			<li>Interpreting /n and /r occurrences in messages</li>
			<li>Saving log to file</li>
			<li>Choosing between Hungarian and English language</li>
		</ul>
