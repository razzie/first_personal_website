		<h3>Logic Circuit Simulator</h3>
		<p>
			Logic Circuit Simulator was a university project I developed together with a friend of mine.
			It offers a variety of logic gates and a lot of visual customization options. Some special elements are
			also available, like seven-segment display, matrix display, JK flip-flop, adjustable timer and
			<i>module</i>. A selected part of a logic circuit can be converted to a module, where the circuit's
			input elements (buttons, switches) become the input pins and output elements (LEDs) become the
			output pins of the module. Modules also support recursion.
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Gates: AND, NAND, NOT, OR, NOR, XOR, NXOR</li>
			<li>Inputs: switch, push button, adjustable timer</li>
			<li>Outputs: LED, seven-segment display, matrix display</li>
			<li>Special elements: JK flip-flop, module</li>
			<li>Visual customization options and themes (presets)</li>
			<li>Multiple projects tabs</li>
			<li>Minimap: an optional separate windows which shows<br />
				the whole circuit in miniature scale</li>

		<h3>Razzie Messenger</h3>
		<p>
			Razzie Messenger is a messenger client and server I started working on during a one-week vacation
			at lake Balaton (Hungary). If you are wondering about the choice of name, Razzie is my internet
			nickname.<br />
			The messenger uses a very simple plain text based protocol for network communication, look at the
			picture to see it in details. (Since then I prefer binary protocols due to the ineffeciency of
			string parsing and large packet sizes in case of text protocols.) The user can chose a nickname
			and pick colors for the name and the text messages. There is no registration and password authentication,
			however the server rejects the connection if a nickname is already taken in the current session. It is
			possible to send a file to an other user: in this case the server opens a random port which receives and
			forwards the file. Both users have to connect to this port, but it is done automatically.
			This solution was necessary due to the limitations of the text based protocol.
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>User states: available, away, hidden (can still communicate), passive (can't communicate)</li>
			<li>Displays several smileys visually</li>
			<li>File sending option (drag & drop)</li>
			<li>Nudge (shakes the other user's screen)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Server - client application</h3>
		<p>
			Server - client application is a small tool which helps creating and debugging text based network
			protocols. I developed it while working on Razzie Messenger and it had a great use. On the server tab
			the user can select one of the connected clients as a message target or just close the connection to them.
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Server: listening on selected port, sending messages to connected clients separately, sending welcome message
				to new connections (optional)</li>
			<li>Client: connecting to selected host (ip or hostname) and port, sending messages to server</li>
			<li>Interpreting /n and /r occurrences in messages</li>
			<li>Saving log to file</li>
			<li>Choosing between Hungarian and English language</li>

		<h3>Prepi</h3>
		<p>
			Prepi is an indie game project I was working on together with a friend. It was intended to be a rage game
			with puzzle elements. We took it so seriously we both quitted our jobs to be able to work on it full-time.
			After several month of development we reached a point where we wanted to introduce our game to the public
			via an Indiegogo campaign. Unfortunately the campaign failed, mostly because the lack of media attention
			(neither of us were expert on the topic). Also the game was probably in too early phase to show it to the
			public. Due to the failure of the campaign and smaller disagreements regarding the game design we decided
			not to continue the development.
		</p>

			Check out the Steam Greenlight page if you are interested:<br />
			<a href="http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357529391" target="_blank">Prepi on Greenlight</a>
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Web based level designer</li>
			<li>Built-in element types: ground, enemy, reward player, finish (and particle)</li>
			<li>Each element could have motions, behaviors and animations</li>
			<li>Box2D based physics (falling traps, the player could move elements to finish the level etc)</li>
			<li>Built-in console to test features (the console was developed as part of gglib)</li>

		</a>
		<h3>Real-time strategy game</h3>
		<p>
			This was my very first coded game (after finishing some games in an early version of GameMaker).
			I've created all the graphics in Microsoft Paint, so the game looked terrible. The point of the game
			is to destroy the enemy's base. The player needs to collect resources (money and energy) to deploy
			buildings and produce units (soldiers, tanks, citizens, etc). Energy can be harvested by building windmills,
			while money can be gathered by mining. The enemy's AI is very basic: its units are moving randomly and
			if they notice a player building or unit, they just attack it. The enemy also deployed new buildings randomly
			when it had enough resources. Due to the lack of timing, the more units appeared in the game, the more they
			became slower.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game is very old and doesn't really work under my current OS (Windows 8.1). I couldn't make a screenshot
			with buildings and units (even the current one was painful to capture).
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Buildings: base, soldier building, tank building, energy harvesting (windmill)</li>
			<li>Units: citizen (for money gathering), 2 soldiers, 2 tanks</li>
			<li>Basic enemy AI for moving units and deploy new buildings</li>
			<li>Saving and loading the game state</li>

		<h3>Labyrinth</h3>
		<p>
			Labyrinth is a small university project I developed together with a friend. It features random
			labyrinth generation with size, multi-level options. The user could select the wall and floor
			texturess or the optional bush wall (instead of the rock one). I have done the rendering part
			(using Irrlicht 3D engine) while my friend worked on the random generator algorithm and the bush
			modeling.
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Configurable labyrinth</li>
			<li>Multiple level support (each level has a single hole where the player can fall down to the level below)</li>
			<li>Selectable wall and floor textures (even multiple textures for a single labyrinth)</li>
			<li>Option to disable gravity and collision (for testing)</li>
			<li>Option to enable light and bump mapping</li>

		<h3>Flyff.extra.hu</h3>
		<p>
			Flyff.extra.hu was a hungarian fan site of Flyff (Fly For Fun) online game. During the 3-4 years
			of its existence I developed more and more new features to make it a fully functional web portal.
			It was very interesting to see it slowly getting attention. Members started generating content in
			the forms of forum entries, polls, screenshots and news for the home page. The site even had a few
			moderators and admins.<br />
			In 2010 extra.hu decided to close its free hosting service and the site went offline. I could have
			moved it to a different (even paid) hosting service, but I and most members already list interest in
			the game. I still have a backup copy of the site and all of its content.
		</p>
		Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Member registration with necessary functionality (like password reset)</li>
			<li>Private messaging</li>
			<li>Fully dynamic forum with topic groups and topics</li>
			<li>Custom text formatting and smileys enabled for every content of the site</li>
			<li>Voting system</li>
			<li>Screenshot gallery</li>
			<li>News on the home page</li>
			<li>Statistics</li>
