	<h3>Minecraft clone</h3>
	<p>
		Minecraft clone is a graphics project I worked on during the final year of the university. Contrary to
		its name it is not a real clone, it features no game elements. My primary motivation was the recreation
		of a Minecraft-like rendering in C++.
	</p>
	Features:
	<ul>
		<li>Minecraft-like graphics</li>
		<li>Random generation based on 3D Perlin noise</li>
		<li>Clipping of non-visible faces</li>
		<li>Runtime generation and release of block chunks while moving</li>
		<li>Runtime addition and removal of blocks</li>
		<li>Postprocessing effects</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Hexagon</h3>
	<p>
		Hexagon is very similar to the Minecraft demo above, but I wanted to try rendering hexagon blocks (hexagonal
		prisms to be correct) instead of cubes. The underlying datastructure is still a 3D grid of Perlin noise. One
		of the main differences is that this demo does not use textures, but has a custom shader that draws grass or
		rock detail based on the normal vectors.
	</p>
	Features:
	<ul>
		<li>Random generation based on 3D Perlin noise</li>
		<li>Clipping of non-visible faces</li>
		<li>One custom shader without the use of textures</li>
		<li>Camera angle and zoom bound to mouse</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Ground tool</h3>
	<p>
		The idea behind the demo was a game with floating islands. Though this game never made it to
		the reality, Ground tool was born as a result of experimenting with the rendering of these islands.
		The user can draw a polygon border to the island and when all points are connected, the program
		generates an island which can be inspected by zooming and moving the camera around.
	</p>
	Features:
	<ul>
		<li>Dynamic generation of a floating island from a user drawn polygon</li>
		<li>Supports triangulation of both convex and concave polygons</li>
		<li>Camera angle and zoom bound to mouse</li>
	</ul>
