	<h3>Minecraft clone</h3>
	<p>
		Minecraft clone is a graphics project I worked on during the final year of the university. Contrary to
		its name it is not a real clone, it features no game elements. My primary motivation was the recreation
		of a Minecraft-like rendering in C++.

	<h3>Hexagon</h3>
	<p>
		This one is very similar to the Minecraft demo above, but I wanted to try rendering hexagon blocks instead
		of cubes. The underlying datastructure is still a 3D grid of Perlin noise. One of the main differences is that
		this demo does not use textures, but has a custom shader that draws grass or rock detail based on the normal vectors.

	<h3>Ground tool</h3>
	<p>
		I recently had the idea of creating a game with floating islands. Though this game never made it to
		the reality, Ground tool was born as a result of experimenting with the rendering of these islands.
